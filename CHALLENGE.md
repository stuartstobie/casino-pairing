### Get started
1. Start the service `yarn dev`
2. Explore the app. Explore the Code. Explore the Console Output (browser). Explore the tests.

### THE FUN BEGINS
Start in the frontend:

1. Poker tiles show RTP even though poker games don't have an RTP. Please remove it from poker tiles only.
2. Game Info isn't working, can you get it to open and close?
3. You can, great! But is it working as expected? (you might need to dive into the backend about now...)
4. Can you get all the backend unit tests passing?
5. Looks like one of the test suites is skipped, could you write those tests?
6. The bingo page is looking very empty isn't it, time to build it.
7. Is there anything you would change, refactor, or restyle? (discussion/extension)
8. We would like to add a new product category, how would you do that? (discussion)
