### Get started
1. Start the service `yarn dev`
2. Explore the app. Explore the Code. Explore the tests.

### THE FUN BEGINS
Start in the frontend:

1. Poker tiles show RTP even though poker games don't have an RTP. Please remove it from poker tiles only.
2. Game Info isn't opening, can you get it to work?
3. You can, great! But is it working as expected? (you might need to dive into the backend about now)
3. Can you get all the unit tests passing?
4. Looks like one of the test suites is skipped, could you write those tests?
5. The bingo page is looking very empty isn't it (optional)
6. Is there anything you would change, refactor, or restyle? (extension)
