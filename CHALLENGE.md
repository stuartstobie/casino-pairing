### Get started
1. Start the service by running `yarn dev`
2. Explore the app. Explore the code. Explore the console output (browser/terminal). Explore the tests.

### THE FUN BEGINS

#### Start in the frontend:

1. Poker tiles show RTP even though poker games don't have an RTP. Please remove it from poker tiles only.
2. Game Info isn't working, can you get it to open and close?
3. You can, great! But is it working as expected? 

#### Moving to the backend:

4. Still no data for game info... Run `yarn test:watch`. Can you use TDD to write the game-info service?
5. Looks like one of the test suites is skipped, could you write those tests? (keep it simple, or discuss if time is running out)

#### More frontend:

6. The bingo page is looking empty isn't it, time to build it.

#### Extension/Discussion:

7. Is there anything you would change, refactor, or restyle? (discussion/extension)
8. We would like to add a new product category, how would you do that? (discussion)
